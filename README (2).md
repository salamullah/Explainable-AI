# Explainable AI: Using LIME & SHAP

## Overview
This project explores the use of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to enhance the explainability of AI models. These frameworks help in understanding the workings of AI models, which are often considered 'Black Boxes'.

## Key Concepts
- **LIME**: A technique to explain the predictions of any machine learning classifier.
- **SHAP**: A method to explain individual predictions using game theory.

## Libraries Used
- LIME
- SHAP
- Other standard Python libraries

## Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset to demonstrate the explainability techniques, though the specific dataset is not mentioned in the initial cells.

## Structure
1. **Introduction**: Overview of explainable AI and the need for LIME and SHAP.
2. **Setup**: Instructions for setting up the environment.
3. **Implementation**: Code examples demonstrating the use of LIME and SHAP.
4. **Conclusion**: Key takeaways and insights from the analysis.

## Usage
To run the notebook, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and execute the cells in order.

## Conclusion
LIME and SHAP are powerful tools for understanding AI models, providing insights into model predictions and helping to build trust in AI systems.
